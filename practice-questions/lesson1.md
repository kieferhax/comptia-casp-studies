# Lesson 1 Practice Questions

## Question 1
What are the two major components of risk? (Select all that apply.)
- Impact
- Exploitability
- Integrity
- Likelihood

**Answer**
- Impact
- Likelihood

*Impact* is the severity of the risk when realized. Determining factors include the scope, the value of the asset, or the financial impacts of the event.

The *likelihood* of occurrence is the probability that a threat is taking place.

*Exploitability* is a factor, though not one of the main components. It is one of the primary scores multiplied to assess the CVSS score.

While *integrity* is not one of the main components, it does play a role in calculating scores based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The integrity metric describes the type of information alteration that might occur if an attacker successfully exploits the vulnerability


## Question 2
A security engineer at a software company is currently analyzing its supply chain. What would the company's supply chain most likely involve? (Select all that apply.)

**Answers**
- Source code repositories
- Development language(s)
- Third-party libraries

Platforms where developers store and manage their code play a significant role.  Examples like GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket are vital components of many modern software supply chains. Events such as Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub highlight the importance of these repositories in the software supply chain.

The programming language can have various implications, such as the libraries and frameworks a company might use and their target platforms. While Java does not charge licensing fees, Oracle's new subscription model for Oracle JDK has made some companies consider alternatives like OpenJDK.

Third-party libraries are often integrated into software projects to expedite development. They can also represent security risks if they aren't updated regularly or originate from untrusted sources.

Chips are not likely to be involved in software company supply chains but are much more likely to be part of companies that sell hardware.

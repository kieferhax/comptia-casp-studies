# Lesson 1 Practice Questions

## Question 1
What are the two major components of risk? (Select all that apply.)
- Impact
- Exploitability
- Integrity
- Likelihood

**Answer**
- Impact
- Likelihood

*Impact* is the severity of the risk when realized. Determining factors include the scope, the value of the asset, or the financial impacts of the event.

The *likelihood* of occurrence is the probability that a threat is taking place.

*Exploitability* is a factor, though not one of the main components. It is one of the primary scores multiplied to assess the CVSS score.

While *integrity* is not one of the main components, it does play a role in calculating scores based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The integrity metric describes the type of information alteration that might occur if an attacker successfully exploits the vulnerability


## Question 2
A security engineer at a software company is currently analyzing its supply chain. What would the company's supply chain most likely involve? (Select all that apply.)

- Chips
- Source code repositories
- Development language
- Third-party libraries

**Answers**
- Source code repositories
- Development language(s)
- Third-party libraries

Platforms where developers store and manage their code play a significant role.  Examples like GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket are vital components of many modern software supply chains. Events such as Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub highlight the importance of these repositories in the software supply chain.

The programming language can have various implications, such as the libraries and frameworks a company might use and their target platforms. While Java does not charge licensing fees, Oracle's new subscription model for Oracle JDK has made some companies consider alternatives like OpenJDK.

Third-party libraries are often integrated into software projects to expedite development. They can also represent security risks if they aren't updated regularly or originate from untrusted sources.

Chips are not likely to be involved in software company supply chains but are much more likely to be part of companies that sell hardware.


## Question 3
A security architect is planning a Statement of Work to perform services at various levels of the Risk Management Lifecycle. The security architect should allocate the most hours to which phase?

- Identify
- Assess
- Control
- Review

**Answer**
- Control

The control phase identifies effective ways to reduce identified risks. The effective identification and implementation of these controls represents a significant amount of work effort undertaken by security practitioners.

The identify phase includes the identification of risk items. In accordance with the beginning critical security controls, security starts with a foundation of inventorying.

The assess phase analyzes identified risks to determine their associated level of risk

In the review phase, an administrator must periodically re-evaluate each risk item to determine if the risk level has changed or if the identified controls are still effective.


## Question 4
A security manager is standing up a Risk Management program at a company. What should the security manager set up tht might be considered the most recognized output?

- Processes
- Key Performance Indicators
- Key Risk Indicators
- Risk Register

**Answer**
- Risk Register

The risk register can be the most recognized output of the risk management program. It includes metadata such as threat, impact, likelihood, plan, and risk level.

Processes are an important component of risk, but the risk register would be the most recognized output.  Processes drive consistency and reliability.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are a formal mechanism designed to measure the performance of a program against desired goals.

Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are closely related to KPIs. By analyzing KPIs, trends may appear and be indicative of additional risk items and should be further analyzed and addressed proactively.


## Question 5
A disaster recovery manager is trying to assess the residual risk when comparing it to the company's inherent risk. What measures should the manager look at to determine this? (Select all that apply.)

- Risk Transference
- Risk Acceptance
- Risk Appetite
- Risk Mitigation

**Answer**
- Risk Transference
- Risk Acceptance
- Risk Mitigation

Risk transference is one component of finding residual risk compared to inherent risk. It means assigning risk to a third-party, typically exemplified through the purchase of an insurance policy.

Risk acceptance is another component of finding residual risk compared to inherent risk. An admin identifies and evaluates the risk area, resulting in an agreement to continue operating software, hardware, processes, or other tasks.

Risk mitigation is another component of finding residual risk compared to inherent risk. It is the overall process of reducing exposure to, or the effects of, risk factors. This is where the work of risk management really comes into focus.

Risk appetite is a strategic assessment of what level of residual risk is tolerable for an organization.


## Question 6
A security architect for an organization is conducting an internal assessment on current policies, processes, and procedures to ensure protection for the businesses' technology and financial operations. Which of the following would be best suited to support this assessment?

- STAR
- SOC
- ISO
- CMMC

**Answer**
- SOC

System and Organization Controls (SOC) uses standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to evaluate policies, processes, and procedures to protect technology and financial operations.

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Security Trust and Risk (STAR) program demonstrate a cloud service provider's adherence to key principles of transparency, auditing, and best practice security operations.

International Organization for Standardization (ISO) audits can evaluate many aspects of an organization. However, in terms of cybersecurity, an audit for compliance with the ISO 27K standard is most relevant.

Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) is a set of cybersecurity standards developed and designed by the US DoD to help fortify the DoD supply chain.


## Question 7
A risk assessment consultant is discussing segmentation options with a client. What are a few standard options the consultant could offer? (Select all that apply).

- VLANs
- Transmission Control
- Physical
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)

**Answers**
- VLANs
- Physical

A network device can perform segmentation logically, for example, implementing virtual local area networks (VLANs). A system can bypass VLANs if an attacker gains access to a trunk port where all VLANs can talk.

Physical segmentation is another type of segmentation more commonly found in industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks. This is where, traditionally, there is an IT and OT (operational technology) network.

Transmission control is not a type of segmentation. Transmission control defines how a system protects communication channels from infiltration, exploitation, and interception.

Access control lists (ACLs) are used to define permissions on a network, file, or object. While they can restrict access to resources, they do not segment a network in the same way as VLANs or physical segmentation.


## Question 8
A security consultant is conducting a security assessment and is trying to communicate reasons that flaws may exist. What are the primary categories in which these flaws exist? (Select all that apply.)

- Communication
- People
- Process
- Technology

**Answer**
- People
- Process
- Technology

People ultimately are most directly impacted by technology. This is one of the major categories for finding flaws and the reason phishing is the most common form of breaches.

Process is another major area where flaws occur. An ambiguous process might exist that allows attacks to use fraudulent emails to request wire transfers.

Technological controls also provide effective defenses against many security threats, but they also rely on people and processes.

While communication is a component of people and processes, the three main categories where flaws exist are people, process, and technology.

## Question 9
A security engineer is considering moving his organization's IT service to the cloud but is concerned whether the vendor they are considering will be in business on an ongoing basis. What type of vendor assessment is this?

- Vendor viability
- Source code escrow
- Vendor lock in
- Vendor lockout

**Answer**
- Vendor viability

Vendor viability considers whether a vendor will remain in business on an ongoing basis, that they have a viable and in-demand product, and the financial means to stay afloat.

Source code escrow is a copy of vendor-developed source code provided to a trusted third party in case a vendor ceases business.

Vendor lock-in occurs when a customer is completely dependent on a vendor for products or services, as switching is either impossible or would result in substantial complexity and costs.

Vendor lockout occurs when a vendor develops its product in such a way that makes it inoperable with other products, and the ability to integrate it with other vendor products is not a feasible option.

## Question 10 
A vulnerability management lead for a major company is working with various teams to keep their company secure, but there are a significant amount of legacy systems the company worries about, so the management lead recommends purchasing an insurance policy. What type of risk strategy is this?

- Risk avoidance
- Risk acceptance
- Risk mitigation
- Risk transference

**Answers**
- Risk transference

Risk transference (or sharing) refers to assigning risk to a third party. Purchasing an insurance policy most typically exemplifies risk transference.

Risk avoidance means to stop doing the activity considered to be risk-bearing.

Risk acceptance means that an identified risk area has been evaluated and results in an agreement to continue operating the software, hardware, processes, actions, or other types of similar tasks, despite the identified risks.

Risk mitigation is the overall process of reducing exposure to, or the effects of, risk factors. This is where the work of risk management really comes into focus.

## Question 11
A security analyst is performing a security assessment and is recommending ways to manage risk relating to personnel. Which of the following should the analyst recommend? (Select all that apply.)

- Mandatory Vacation
- Least privilege
- Email protection 
- Auditing requirements

**Answers**
- Mandatory vacation
- Least privilege
- Auditing requirements

Mandatory vacation is one way of helping to manage personnel risk. An administrator forces employees to take their vacation time, during which someone else fulfills their duties.

The principle of least privilege is a practice in which an administrator only gives users account privileges they need to perform their duties. This practice serves in various capacities, such as helping against both insider threats and compromised accounts.

Auditing requirements describe the capability for auditing account creation, modification, deletion, and account activity for all accounts. Auditing is a way to help manage personnel risk.

Email protection is a technical control, although it does help to safeguard against attacks against personnel.


## Question 12
A U.S. government agency has contracted a risk auditor to conduct a risk assessment. Which of the following frameworks should the auditor use?

- ISO 31000
- COBIT
- NIST RMF
- COSO

**Answer**
- NIST RMF

The National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF) defines standards that US Federal Agencies must use to assess and manage cybersecurity risks.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is one of the world's largest developers of standards. Many international organizations have adopted ISO standards to establish a common taxonomy among diverse industries.

The Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) is a framework created and maintained by Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA). COBIT frames IT risk from a business leadership viewpoint.

The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) is an initiative of five private sector organizations collaborating on the development of risk management frameworks.


## Question 13
A security engineer works for a mid-sized retail company on the systems administration team. The company wants to estimate the potential financial impact of a single occurrence of a web server going down, which could lead to lost sales. What is this estimated financial impact per incident called?

- SLE
- ALE
- ARO
- EF

**Answer**
- SLE

Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) is the amount lost in a single occurrence of the risk factor, such as the cost during downtime.

Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) is the amount lost over the course of a year, or the sum-total of all single loss events over the span of 12 months.

Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) is the number of times in a year that the single loss occurs.

Exposure Factor (EF) is the percentage of the asset value lost. The SLE is equal to the exposure factor multiplied by the Asset Value (AV). The AV is the value of an asset, such as a server or even an entire building.


## Question 14
A disaster recovery manager wants to perform a qualitative analysis on intangible assets but is unsure how to perform the calculations. Which departments should the manager bring on to help determine metrics? (Select all that apply.)

- Marketing
- Sales
- Human Resources
- Communications

**Answers**
- Marketing
- Sales
- Communications

Marketing is one of the departments that should help the manager with the metrics. Qualitative risk assessment is well-suited to the analysis of intangible assets, for example, an organization's reputation or brand image.

Sales is another department brought on to assist the manager with metrics. These groups are best-suited to provide input based on their unique insights.

Communications is another department that can help the manager assess the value of many intangible business assets and the impacts that various risk events can have on them.

The Human Resource department does not necessarily need to participate in an intangible metric discussion.


## Question 15
A security project manager is considering transitioning to a cloud-based strategy for a company. The company currently operates with a minimal team in their data center services and aims to reduce their responsibilities while maintaining service quality. Which cloud solution would require the least amount of management and maintenance from this team?

- IaaS
- PaaS
- SaaS
- On-Site

**Answer**
- SaaS

Software as a Service (SaaS) represents the lowest amount of responsibility for the customer as the facilities, utilities, physical security, platform, and applications are the provider's responsibility.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides hardware hosted at a provider facility, using the provider's physical security controls and utilities, such as power.

Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides a selection of operating systems loaded and configured by the customer. The underlying infrastructure, facilities, utilities, and physical security are the provider's responsibility.

On-premise would not alleviate the company's workload since it would still remain on-site, and they would be responsible for everything.


## Question 16
A security architect is explaining logistics security to a non-technical person. What term would the security architect use to describe all of the suppliers, vendors, and partners needed to deliver a final product?

- Transmission Control
- Vendor policy
- Vendor viability
- Supply chain

**Answer**
- Supply Chain

The supply chain describes all of the suppliers, vendors, and partners needed to deliver a final product. The supply chain presents a significant amount of risk.

Transmission control defines how a system protects communication channels from infiltration, exploitation, and interception.

Establishing the maturity of vendor security operations and defining the minimum set of requirements and expectations in a policy is essential.

Vendor viability is important when determining if a vendor will be in business on an ongoing basis, that they have a viable and in-demand product, and the financial means to stay afloat.

# Lesson 1 Practice Questions

1. What are the two major components of risk? (Select all that apply.)
A. Impact
B. Exploitability
C. Integrity
D. Likelihood

**Impact** is the severity of the risk when realized. Determining factors include the scope, the value of the asset, or the financial impacts of the event.

The **likelihood** of occurrence is the probability that a threat is taking place.

**Exploitability** is a factor, though not one of the main components. It is one of the primary scores multiplied to assess the CVSS score.

While **integrity** is not one of the main components, it does play a role in calculating scores based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The integrity metric describes the type of information alteration that might occur if an attacker successfully exploits the vulnerability

**Answer**
A. Impact
D. Likelihood

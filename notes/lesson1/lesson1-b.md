# Summarize the Risk Life Cycle
It is essential that risks are formally identified and documented so that they can be properly analyzed and prioritized by leadership teams. There are many risks to consider but only a finite set of resources available to address them. Through the clear identification, analysis, and prioritization of risk, the most pressing risk items can be addressed and, by focusing the work effort on the most pressing items, the organization's overall risk level can be more effectively reduced.

Risk management describes the set of policies and processes used by an organization to help it locate, describe, prioritize, and mitigate risks in a consistent and repeatable way. Put another way, risk management formalizes the identification and control of risks. Formalizing the risk management process ensures that all stakeholders are aware of existing risks, the potential impacts these risks may impose, and also the agreed upon methods used to mitigate them.

## Identifying Risk Frameworks
Risk frameworks form the basis of a risk management program and also serve an authoritative reference to support the organization's existing program. Just as risk management programs vary from one organization to another, frameworks are similarly varied. Unless otherwise directed by regulations or corporate policy, an organization should select a risk framework based on its unique attributes and features and how well these match the business.

**NIST CSF**
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is an incredibly popular framework and is widely adopted in the US. The NIST CSF helps organizations define five core functions within a cybersecurity program.

The five core functions are:
1) Identify
2) Protect
3) Detect
4) Respond
5) Recover

In addition, the NIST CSF defines several required steps when performing risk management.

The risk management steps are:
1) Prioritize and Scope
2) Orient
3) Create a Current Profile
4) Conduct a Risk Assessment
5) Create a Target Profile
6) Determine, Analyze, and Prioritize Gaps
7) Implement Action Plan

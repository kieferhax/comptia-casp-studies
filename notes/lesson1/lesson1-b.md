# Summarize the Risk Life Cycle
It is essential that risks are formally identified and documented so that they can be properly analyzed and prioritized by leadership teams. 

There are many risks to consider but only a finite set of resources available to address them. 

Through the clear identification, analysis, and prioritization of risk, the most pressing risk items can be addressed and, by focusing the work effort on the most pressing items, the organization's overall risk level can be more effectively reduced.

Risk management describes the set of policies and processes used by an organization to help it locate, describe, prioritize, and mitigate risks in a consistent and repeatable way. Put another way, risk management formalizes the identification and control of risks. 

Formalizing the risk management process ensures that all stakeholders are aware of existing risks, the potential impacts these risks may impose, and also the agreed upon methods used to mitigate them.

## Identifying Risk Frameworks
Risk frameworks form the basis of a risk management program and also serve an authoritative reference to support the organization's existing program. Just as risk management programs vary from one organization to another, frameworks are similarly varied. Unless otherwise directed by regulations or corporate policy, an organization should select a risk framework based on its unique attributes and features and how well these match the business.

**NIST CSF**
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is an incredibly popular framework and is widely adopted in the US. The NIST CSF helps organizations define five core functions within a cybersecurity program.

The five core functions are:
1) Identify
2) Protect
3) Detect
4) Respond
5) Recover

In addition, the NIST CSF defines several required steps when performing risk management.

The risk management steps are:
1) Prioritize and Scope
2) Orient
3) Create a Current Profile
4) Conduct a Risk Assessment
5) Create a Target Profile
6) Determine, Analyze, and Prioritize Gaps
7) Implement Action Plan

**NIST RMF**
The NIST RMF defines standards that US Federal Agencies must use to assess and manage cybersecurity risks. NIST RMF defines several distinct steps required in an effective risk management program.

The RMF steps are:
1) Prepare
2) Categorize
3) Select
4) Implement
5) Assess
6) Authorize
7) Monitor

**ISO 31000**
The International Organization for Standardization is one of the world's largest developers of standards. ISO standards are adopted by many international organizations to establish a common taxonomy among diverse industries. ISO 31000, also known as ISO 31k, is a very comprehensive framework and considers risks outside of cybersecurity, including risks to financial, legal, competitive, and customer service functions.

More details regarding ISO 31000 can be obtained via:
[ISO 31000 Risk Management](https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html)

**COBIT**
A framework created and maintained by ISACA, the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies frames IT risk from the viewpoint of business leadership. The COBIT framework is composed of five major components:
1) Framework
2) Process descriptions
3) Control objectives
4) Management guidelines
5) Maturity models

[Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies](https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit)

**COSO**
The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, is an initiative of five private sector organizations collaborating on the development of risk management frameworks. The Enterprise RIsk Management - Integrated Framework defines an approach to managing risk from a strategic leadership point of view.

## Explain Risk Management Life Cycle
**The Risk Management Life Cycle**
![The Risk Management Life Cycle](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wmx-api-production/courses/17541/images/7207-1626186332843-cas_fig01_02.png)

Risk constantly evolves and shifts due to many factors such as changes in an organization's strategy, changes within the industry, changes by vendor partners, and changes in the software and platforms used on a daily basis. Due to the dynamic nature of risk, it must be managed on a continual basis.

Risk management tasks are defined by a life cycle. The four major phases common to all risk management life cycles include:
- Identify - This phase includes the identification of risk items.
- Assess - This phase analyzes identified risks to determine their associated level of risk
- Control - This phase identifies effective means by which identified risks can be reduced.
- Review - Each risk item must be periodically re-evaluated to determine if the risk level has changed and/or if the identified controls are still effective

*Often referred to as 'mitigating controls,' the effective identification and implementation of these controls represents a significant amount of the work effort undertaken by security practitioners*

## Understanding Control Categories
**People, Process, & Technology**
Understanding the dynamics of people, process, and technology is essential to any successful initiative that seeks to implement change. Analyzing and understanding these impacts *before* making changes is important. When designing and implementing controls identified via the risk management program, careful analysis of these dynamics should influence which controls are used and how they are implemented. Changes to one of the factors of people, process, and technology will impact the others - they are inseparable!

![An illustration of control categories](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wmx-api-production/courses/17541/images/8602-1626186369729-cas_fig01_03.png)

**People**
Those who perform the work in an organization. People ultimately are the ones most directly impacted by technology. What sounds great on paper may not work well in practice and this can result in unintended consequences - such as increased calls to the help desk and/or drops in productivity. People are more likely to bypass security controls when they are overly burdensome and/or are implemented without adequate training on their purpose and proper use.

**Processes**
All important work must be defined and described in a process. The process should include detailed descriptions of the necessary steps required to successfully complete a task. Processes, just like instructions, drive consistency and reliability and remove doubt and individual interpretations when completing a task. In addition, processes should be periodically analyzed to ascertain that they are being used consistency and that the outputs match expectations.

**Technology**
Technology alone does not solve any problems. Ultimately, technology needs the people and processes in place around it in order for it to be effective. Only after careful consideration of requirements and need should technology be selected.

## Understanding Control Objectives
**The Five Functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
![An illustration of the NIST Cybersecurity framework](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wmx-api-production/courses/17541/images/869-1626186441215-cas_fig01_04.png)

The NIST Cybersecurity framework is widely adopted and freely available. It is important to understand how the Cybersecurity framework deconstruct the capabilities of a successful and comprehensive cybersecurity program into five capabilities. The five capabilities defined in the NIST cybersecurity Framework include:

**Identify**
This function involves the analysis and management of organizational risks. Risks can be realized in many areas, including people, data, systems, and processes and this process works to help an organization locate, describe and analyze these risks in order to develop a prioritized approach to their management.

**Protect**
This function describes the capabilities needed to ensure consistent operation of all critical business functions and limit the impacts of any adverse events.

**Detect**
This function defines the capabilities needed for the timely discovery of security incidents.

**Respond**
This function seeks to limit the impact of a cybersecurity incident by defining appropriate actions to be taken upon its discovery.

**Recover**
This function defines the necessary activities for restoring any disrupted service to their original, or intended state, following a cybersecurity incident.

## Explore Risk Tracking Methods
As previously described, risk management describes the set of policies and processes used by an organization to help it locate, describe, and rank risks in a consistent and repeatable way. One of the tangible outputs of risk management is the risk register. A risk register can be used to measure, at a high level, progress over time. The risk register not only identifies risks but also includes controls designed to limit potential impacts of each risk item.

*The iterative process of risk management includes periodic reviews of the risk register in order to determine the implementation status of each item - for example, analyzing the extent to which the identified controls have been implemented since the last review.*

**Key Performance Indicators**
Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are a formal mechanism designed to measure performance of a program against desired goals. It helps identify the effectiveness of a cybersecurity program by defining the crucial goals and desired outcomes of the program.

**Key Risk Indicators**
Key Risk Indicators (KRI) are closely related to KPIs. By analyzing KPI's, trends may appear and be indicative of additional risk items. These newly identified items should be further analyzed and addressed in a proactive way.

**Risk Register**
First identified as an effective tool in the ISO 27001 standard, risk registers provide an effective visualization of identified risks and include descriptions and information about mitigating controls. It can be considered as the most recognized output of the risk management program. The creation of the risk register requires collaboration between many departments and should be considered a working document, meaning it is never completed.

## Understanding KPI & KRI
**Key Performance Indicators**
Key Performance Indicators are a formal mechanism designed to measure the effectiveness of a cybersecurity program by defining the crucial goals and desired outcomes of the program.

Some examples of KPIs include: patch status, intrusion attempts, unidentified devices, security incidents (password breach, infection, unauthorized access), time between incident and detection, time between detection and resolution, vendor compliance, user awareness and effectiveness of training, policy/regulation compliance, access management (privileged accounts and/or private group members), and cost per incident.

Additionally, KPIs can be formulated to measure the scalability, reliability, and availability of an organization's critical infrastructure and services.

**Key Risk Indicators**
Key Risk Indicators identify emerging risks and include the objective of adapting to these identified risks before impacts are realized. KRIs are closely related to KPIs as KRIs depend on the analysis of trends revealed through KPI measurements. Newly identified risk items can be further analyzed and addressed as warranted.

For example, after reviewing KPIs it might be determined that many incidents involving unauthorized access are being reported. This trend might indicate that internal access control mechanisms are not effective.

**Scalability**
Scalability refers to the capacity of a system to handle increases in workload. A system that scales well can easily adapt to increases in workload in order to maintain a consistent level of performance

**Reliability**
Reliability refers to a capability of a system to perform without error and describes a system that includes features to avoid, detect, and/or repair component failures.

**Availability**
Availability describes the probability that a system will be operating as expected at any given point in time. Availability is typically measured as "uptime."

## Review Risk Appetite & Risk Tolerance
**Risk Appetite**
Risk appetite is often prescribed via regulations and defines how an organization will address identified risks. Some organizations will assertively address all items ranked via risk assessment as "medium" and "high." Other organizations may focus their attention only on items ranked as "high," and other may take a completely different approach - but all of these different approaches are based on appetite.

**Risk Tolerance**
Risk tolerance defines the threshold that separate different levels of risk. Thresholds may be defined by money, impact, scope, time, compliance, and privacy, and describe the level of risk acceptable in order to achieve a goal.

**Tradeoff Analysis**
Tradeoff analysis describes how decisions are made after removing risks and rewards, by comparing potential benefits to potential risks, and determining a course of action based on adjusting factors that contribute to each area. The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University developed the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM), which allows formal evaluation of architectures based upon the analysis of risks and desired outcomes.

A practical example of tradeoff analysis also includes the constant battle between usability versus security requirements. Establishing a balance between "secure" and "usable" can be difficult. By over-accommodating one factor the other is compromised. Put differently, implementing the highest levels of security in all scenarios will result in unintended consequences. When considering usernames and passwords for example, very long and complex password requirements often result in lost productivity and high call volumes to the help desk.

## Managing People Risks
**Managing People Risks**
People are arguably the single most complicated and dynamic element to manage within a cybersecurity program, but with so much focus on technological controls it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the ultimate goal of the cybersecurity program is to provide a safe and secure environment for an organization's employees. Employees' skills and motivations cover a very broad spectrum, some things to consider include:
- People are under pressure to meet productivity metrics and quotas.
- People make mistakes
- People have malicious intent
- People can be tricked

Technology alone cannot guarantee a safe and secure environment, so it is absolutely essential for people to be trained in the safe and appropriate use of technology and that user activity within an information system can be reviewed for compliance and accountability.

It is also important to consider that people are on the "front lines," they can stop an issue from occurring at the earliest opportunity and also have the greatest insights into what comprises "normal" operation.

**Employment Policies**
The following strategies are designed to reduce the likelihood of fraud and limit the impacts of insider threat.

**Separation of Duties**
Separation of duties is a means of establishing checks and balances against the possibility that critical systems or procedures can be compromised by insider threats. Duties and responsibilities should be divided among individuals to prevent ethical conflicts or abuse of powers.

*An employee is supposed to work for the interests of their organization exclusively. A situation where someone can act in ihs or her own interest, personally, or in the interests of third party, is said to be a conflict of interest*

**Job Rotation**
Job rotation (or rotation of duties) means that no one person is permitted to remain in the same job for an extended period. For example, managers may be moved to different departments periodically, or employees may perform more than one job role, switching between them throughout the year. Rotating individuals into and out of roles, such as the firewall administrator or access control specialist, helps an organization ensure that it is not tied too firmly to any one individual because vital institutional knowledge is spread among trusted employees. Job rotation also helps prevent abuse of power, reduces boredom, and enhances individuals' professional skills.

**Mandatory Vacation**
Mandatory vacation means that employees are forced to take their vacation time, during which someone else fulfills their duties. The typical mandatory vacation policy requires that employees take at least one vacation a year in a full-week increment so that they are away from work for at least five days in a row. During that time, the corporate audit and security employees have time to investigate and discover any discrepancies in employee activities.

**Least Privilege**
Least privilege means that a user is granted sufficient rights to perform his or her job and no more. This mitigates risk if the account should be compromised and fall under the control of a threat actor. Authorization creep refers to a situation where a user acquires more and more rights, either directly or by being added to security groups and roles. Least privilege should be ensured by closely analyzing business workflows to assess what privileges are required and by performing regular account audits.

**Employment and Termination Procedures**
Employment and Termination Procedures define the specific tasks needed to start or end an individual's tenure within an organization. For new hires, procedures should be developed in a way that allows the new hire to be productive in as short a period of time as possible while still enforcing least privilege. This requires training new employees on organizational policies and having well-defined processes in place to provision user access in an appropriate way, including a requirement to acquire appropriate authorizations and create adequate documentation of the changes. In the case of employee termination, procedures designed to retrieve devices allocated to the employee and revoke access, which is dependent upon accurate documentation of the software, systems, and facilities the employee could access while still employed.

**Training and Awareness for Users**
By many measures, the single most impactful contributor to the overall security posture of an organization is the security awareness of its users. Adversaries will exploit untrained users as a primary mechanism for initial breach. Focused on prevention, security awareness seeks to develop a security-focused culture through training. Awareness training should be tailored to the different audiences within the organization, meaning training for highly technical staff should be different than training offered to executives and non-technical staff. Through increased issue focus, users should become familiar with the tactics and techniques used by attackers, helping to justify the presence of security controls and helping users identify the characteristics of attack. Additionally, awareness training programs are commonly required by contractual and regulatory mandates and so also represent an important compliance requirement.

**Auditing Requirements and Frequency**
Auditing is an essential component to security operations. While the topic of IT auditing can form the basis of an entire course, from the viewpoint of people risks there are a few essential concepts. Firstly, auditing account creation, modification, and deletion. Any changes to accounts should be reviewed to ensure they were performed by authorized personnel and for authorized, documented reasons. Secondly, that account activity is reviewed to determine how accounts are being used and that account usage is in alignment with acceptable use policy and within the boundaries configured for the account - for example that a non-administrative account is not able to perform administrative tasks (which would be indicative of a privilege escalation exploit or misconfiguration.) Account audits should be performed as often as possible, but are realistically performed in accordance with regulatory and/or contractual mandates. The key concept driving audit activity is to identify anomalous behavior (anything indicative of attack, exploit or malicious intent) verify compliance with policies and demonstrate due diligence (that concerted effort is being made to ensure the environment is operating in a safe and secure manner.)

# Summarize the Risk Life Cycle
It is essential that risks are formally identified and documented so that they can be properly analyzed and prioritized by leadership teams. There are many risks to consider but only a finite set of resources available to address them. Through the clear identification, analysis, and prioritization of risk, the most pressing risk items can be addressed and, by focusing the work effort on the most pressing items, the organization's overall risk level can be more effectively reduced.

Risk management describes the set of policies and processes used by an organization to help it locate, describe, prioritize, and mitigate risks in a consistent and repeatable way. Put another way, risk management formalizes the identification and control of risks. Formalizing the risk management process ensures that all stakeholders are aware of existing risks, the potential impacts these risks may impose, and also the agreed upon methods used to mitigate them.

## Identifying Risk Frameworks
Risk frameworks form the basis of a risk management program and also serve an authoritative reference to support the organization's existing program. Just as risk management programs vary from one organization to another, frameworks are similarly varied. Unless otherwise directed by regulations or corporate policy, an organization should select a risk framework based on its unique attributes and features and how well these match the business.

**NIST CSF**
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is an incredibly popular framework and is widely adopted in the US. The NIST CSF helps organizations define five core functions within a cybersecurity program.

The five core functions are:
1) Identify
2) Protect
3) Detect
4) Respond
5) Recover

In addition, the NIST CSF defines several required steps when performing risk management.

The risk management steps are:
1) Prioritize and Scope
2) Orient
3) Create a Current Profile
4) Conduct a Risk Assessment
5) Create a Target Profile
6) Determine, Analyze, and Prioritize Gaps
7) Implement Action Plan

**NIST RMF**
The NIST RMF defines standards that US Federal Agencies must use to assess and manage cybersecurity risks. NIST RMF defines several distinct steps required in an effective risk management program.

The RMF steps are:
1) Prepare
2) Categorize
3) Select
4) Implement
5) Assess
6) Authorize
7) Monitor

**ISO 31000**
The International Organization for Standardization is one of the world's largest developers of standards. ISO standards are adopted by many international organizations to establish a common taxonomy among diverse industries. ISO 31000, also known as ISO 31k, is a very comprehensive framework and considers risks outside of cybersecurity, including risks to financial, legal, competitive, and customer service functions.

**COBIT**
A framework created and maintained by ISACA, the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies frames IT risk from the viewpoint of business leadership. The COBIT framework is composed of five major components:
1) Framework
2) Process descriptions
3) Control objectives
4) Management guidelines
5) Maturity models

**COSO**
The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, is an initiative of five private sector organizations collaborating on the development of risk management frameworks. The Enterprise RIsk Management - Integrated Framework defines an approach to managing risk from a strategic leadership point of view.

## Explain Risk Management Life Cycle
**The Risk Management Life Cycle**

Risk constantly evolves and shifts due to many factors such as changes in an organization's strategy, changes within the industry, changes by vendor partners, and changes in the software and platforms used on a daily basis. Due to the dynamic nature of risk, it must be managed on a continual basis.

Risk management tasks are defined by a life cycle. The four major phases common to all risk management life cycles include:
- Identify - This phase includes the identification of risk items.
- Assess - This phase analyzes identified risks to determine their associated level of risk
- Control - This phase identifies effective means by which identified risks can be reduced.
- Review - Each risk item must be periodically re-evaluated to determine if the risk level has changed and/or if the identified controls are still effective

*Often referred to as 'mitigating controls,' the effective identification and implementation of these controls represents a significant amount of the work effort undertaken by security practitioners*

## Understanding Control Categories
**People, Process, & Technology**
Understanding the dynamics of people, process, and technology is essential to any successful initiative that seeks to implement change. Analyzing and understanding these impacts *before* making changes is important. When designing and implementing controls identified via the risk management program, careful analysis of these dynamics should influence which controls are used and how they are implemented. Changes to one of the factors of people, process, and technology will impact the others - they are inseparable!

**People**
Those who perform the work in an organization. People ultimately are the ones most directly impacted by technology. What sounds great on paper may not work well in practice and this can result in unintended consequences - such as increased calls to the help desk and/or drops in productivity. People are more likely to bypass security controls when they are overly burdensome and/or are implemented without adequate training on their purpose and proper use.

**Processes**
All important work must be defined and described in a process. The process should include detailed descriptions of the necessary steps required to successfully complete a task. Processes, just like instructions, drive consistency and reliability and remove doubt and individual interpretations when completing a task. In addition, processes should be periodically analyzed to ascertain that they are being used consistency and that the outputs match expectations.

**Technology**
Technology alone does not solve any problems. Ultimately, technology needs the people and processes in place around it in order for it to be effective. Only after careful consideration of requirements and need should technology be selected.

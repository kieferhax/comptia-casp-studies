# Assess & Mitigate Vendor Risk
All organizations, regardless of size, depend upon a complicated network of suppliers and contractors. Some of these relationships are obvious, but many are not. 

This complicated, and in many ways hidden, network of people, technology, and products provides a unique and incredibly damaging threat. 

This dynamic and complicated arrangement is referred to simply as Vendor Risk.

Many high-profile and far-reaching cyberattacks in recent years have been the result of exploiting this vast and complicated vendor network. 

Vendors provide hardware and software, access the technology resources of their customers, and frequently provide software and hosting services. 

For these reasons, it is imperative to understand what security measures are in place with all vendors and to identify ways to measure the effectiveness of these measures. 

In addition, a clear map of all vendor relationships is needed in order to fully document specific vendor risks.

## Shared Responsibility Model
The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) forms a very common, and high-profile, vendor relationship for organizations spanning many diverse sizes and industries. 

This relationship is unique as it establishes a very distinct requirement to share the implementation of security. 

This arrangement is commonly referred to as the shared responsibility model .

Shared responsibility model

Identifies that responsibility for the implementation of security as applications, data and workloads are transitioned into a cloud platform are shared between the customer and the cloud service provider (CSP.)

*Identifying the boundary between customer and cloud provider responsibilities, in terms of security, is imperative for reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities into your environment.*

### Cloud Service Types
**Software as a Service (SaaS)** represents the lowest amount of responsibility for the customer as the facilities, utilities, physical security, platform, and applications are the responsibility of the provider.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** provides a selection of operating systems that can be loaded and configured by the customer, the underlying infrastructure, facilities, utilities, and physical security are the responsibility of the provider.

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** provides hardware hosted at a provider facility using the provider's physical security controls and utilities, such as power.

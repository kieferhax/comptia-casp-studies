# Explain Legal Considerations & Contract Types
Organizations need to understand their legal obligations in order to ensure that compliance with these obligations is incorporated into business operations and the overall risk management program. 

In the United States, laws are described in various acts and regulations and heavily dictate the ways in which organizations operate. 

Failure to understand laws, including the potential consequences for regulatory non-compliance, can have far-reaching and devastating impacts for the organization itself as well as its employees, customers, vendors and partners.

## Understanding Legal Considerations
**Rapid Development of Technology and Laws**
The legal environment is adapting quickly in order to keep pace with the increasingly rapid evolution of technology. 

Many new issues are being presented from year to year that include circumstances for which there is no precedent.

In response to this, countries across the world are implementing and enforcing laws that govern how organizations collect, use, store, and protect data. 

Legal adaptation is happening quickly to keep pace with the increasingly rapid adoption and evolution of technology. 

Keeping pace with cyberattack methods, new computer and software platforms, and cyberdefense tools is difficult. 

Compounding this complexity is the pace to which new laws governing how organizations collect, use, store, and protect data are being introduced, and it highlights the need for a well-crafted legal strategy.

**Legal Jurisdiction**

Understanding legal jurisdiction is important when considering legal risk. 

The following lists the various jurisdictions that play a part in understanding legal compliance.

- Federal Laws
- Federal Regulations
- State Laws
- International Law
- Laws in other countries

This is complicated by organizations with international operations and for organizations operating public cloud platforms where the corporation, cloud operations, and customers are dispersed globally.

***NOTE*** *It is typically best to report an incident to the local jurisdiction first, local law enforcement will involve other agencies from other jurisdictions as necessary.*

## Explain Due Care & Due Diligence
**Due Care**
Due care often references the common law "prudent man rule" which describes the reasonable and expected protections put in place to protect an asset. 

The rule is intentionally open-ended as "reasonable and expected" can be defined in many different ways depending upon circumstances. 

In terms of cybersecurity, "reasonable and expected" represent vastly different things when considering the protections in place for military secrets as opposed to the protections in place for a coffee shop Wi-Fi network. 

Despite this, due care represents a baseline that can be used to determine if reasonable safeguards are in place.

**Due Diligence**
When considering due diligence, it is important to keep in mind that "reasonable and expected" protections constantly evolve. 

Many of the protections that were widely regarded as sufficient just a few years ago are not considered adequate by today's measure. 

The protections in use today will fall out of favor in the future. 

To this end, due diligence describes the ongoing and documented effort to continuously evaluate and improve the mechanisms by which assets are protected.

## Explore Legal Holds & E-Discovery
**Legal Holds**
A legal hold, or litigation hold, describes the notification received by an organization's legal team instructing them to preserve electronically stored information (ESI) and/or paper documents that may be relevant to a pending legal case. 

Legal hold authority can be complicated by jurisdiction, but these details are managed by legal teams. 

It is imperative that the cybersecurity team be notified of legal holds as soon as possible in order to ensure data is preserved in accordance with the order. 

Legal hold requirements often exceed the data protection and retention periods ordinarily in place.

**e-Discovery**
e-Discovery describes the electronic component of identifying, collecting, and providing the electronically stored information (ESI) identified by a legal hold. 

The scope of information included in e-Discovery can be vast and include everything from files, emails, logs, text messages, voicemail, databases, and social media activity. 

The scope of information requested in an e-Discovery request can be difficult for many organizations to comply with. 

For organizations that are involved in regular legal activities, generally large organizations and government, specific strategies are often employed to defend against e-Discovery requests. 

Defenses often include well-crafted data retention policies that define stringent periods for which data can be retained. 

However, data retention policies cannot conflict with existing laws that dictate retention periods.

## Understand Export Controls
**National Export Controls**
Many countries impose export controls designed to protect national security and foreign policy objectives. 

Export laws govern the export of commodities, software, and technology. 

Enforcing export controls requires coordination between countries and the establishment of healthy foreign relations.

**Wassenaar Arrangement**
The Wassenaar Arrangement was established in 1996 and defines export controls for "conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies." 

The arrangement includes 42 participating states and generally defines controls crafted to prevent a destabilizing accumulation of weaponry by any single nation and to prevent advanced weaponry and military capabilities from being acquired by terrorist factions.

**Encryption Laws**
The legal standing of encryption varies widely across the world. Some countries do not constrain the use of encryption, whereas others impose very strict limitations.

An excellent resource that highlights the legal stance of countries around the world can be accessed via: [https://www.gp-digital.org/world-map-of-encryption/](https://www.gp-digital.org/world-map-of-encryption/)

***NOTE*** *Technologies commonly used in the United States, such as VPN, may employ encryption techniques that violate laws in other countries. It is important to understand encryption laws in destinations where an organization's staff and employees may travel to.*

## Contract & Agreement Types
**Legally Enforceable Documents**
To govern the relationship between parties, several types of agreements are commonly used. 

When properly crafted, these agreements fortify the legal rights of an organization and serve as an enforcement mechanism that can be used to provide assurance that a vendor, supplier, contractor, or business partner is in compliance with pre-established requirements and expectations.

**Master Service Agreement (MSA)**
Master service agreements are typically "umbrella" contracts that establish an agreement between two entities to conduct business during a defined term (typically a year,) but each engagement within the agreement is typically defined by individual scopes of work that define expectations and deliverables.

**Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**
Non-disclosure agreements are established between entities and define the conditions upon which data and information can be used. 

Mostly, the NDA defines the conditions under which an entity (such as a person or supplier) cannot disclose, or share, information and includes specific descriptions of the legal ramifications for breaking the agreement. 

NDAs serve as a deterrent and provide a legal basis for protecting information assets.

**Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)**
A memorandum of understanding is an extremely useful contract that can be used to establish rules of engagement between two parties. 

Widely considered as a non-binding agreement, or one that is difficult to enforce in a court setting, MOUs instead serve as a formal means to define roles and expectations.

**Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA)**
An interconnection security agreement is established when two entities need to share data via an interface. 

As is common, software and services can be connected via data interfaces for the purpose of providing or retrieving information. 

Such interfaces can form the basis of critical operational functions, and using a data interface can also provide access to sensitive or otherwise protected information. 

Describing and defining the operating parameters, roles, requirements, and expectations of such use is the purpose of the ISA.

**Service Level Agreement (SLA)**
A contractual agreement setting out the detailed terms under which a service is provided. 

SLAs typically govern services that are both measurable and repeatable and include an enforcement mechanism that typically includes financial penalties for non-compliance.

**Operational-Level Agreement (OLA)**
Operational-level agreements are typically internal documents established by an organization to define the essential operational needs of an organization in order for it to meet the performance metrics defined in a Service Level Agreement

**Privacy Level Agreement (PLA)**
A Privacy Level Agreement is commonly used when establishing a relationship with a cloud service provider (CSP) and goes beyond the provisions detailed in an SLA to include metrics and measures related to conforming with specific information privacy and data protection requirements.

# Compare and Contrast Regulation, Accreditation, and Standards
Regulations and standards are tightly integrated. 

Regulations establish the legal basis for enforcing compliance with a set of rules and describe the consequences for non-compliance. 

It is common for regulations to refer to externally published standards when identifying the specific requirements for compliance with the law. 

This separation allows the best practices described in a standard to be continuously updated and improved in response to the rapid development and changes in the cybersecurity field without the need for legislative action to adopt the changes.

**The Relationship Between Regulations and Standards**
Regulations and standards are tightly integrated. Whereby regulations describe legal requirements and ramifications, the details of compliance are oftentimes provided in prescriptive form within a standard.

Two very prominent and widely recognized organizations responsible for publishing and maintaining standards are ISO and NIST. 

ISO and NIST devote considerable time and effort to develop best practices, and their standards represent the collective effort of many industry thought-leaders and practicing experts. 

ISO and NIST do not create laws and regulations, rather laws and regulations identify a requirement to implement the best practice guidance authored by these agencies.

For example, the authority to require U.S. federal agencies to implement a comprehensive information security program is detailed in the Federal Information and Security Modernization Act (FISMA.) 

FISMA is a very detailed piece of legislation and describes many far-reaching requirements for governance, risk, and compliance but, in terms of how an organization will be measured against these requirements, many NIST publications are referenced. 

Two of the NIST standards referenced in FISMA include SP 800-53 - "Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations" and FIPS 199 - Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 199 "Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems."

**National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory agency in the United States that establishes standards and best-practices across the entire science and technology field. 

NIST publishes a wide variety of guidance and best-practices within the field of information technology including cybersecurity. 

Within the field of cybersecurity, the special publication (SP) 800 series documents, as well as the Risk Management Framework and Cybersecurity Framework, are some of the most widely adopted and referenced materials in the industry. 

More information regarding NIST cybersecurity publications can be obtained via: [https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity)

**International Organizations for Standardization (ISO)**
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) manages and publishes a cybersecurity framework commonly referred to as ISO 27k. 

The 27k framework was established in 2005, revised in 2013, and then revised again in 2018. 

ISO 27k includes over a dozen standards, including 27002, which defines security controls; 27017/27018 for cloud security; 27701, which focuses on personal data and privacy; and many others.

Unlike the NIST framework, the ISO 27001 Information Security Management standard cannot be obtained free of charge. 

More information about the ISO information security management standard can be obtained via [https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html_)

***NOTE*** *The acronym for ISO can be a source of confusion. Due to its international scope, International Organization for Standardization translates into many different languages and would require many different acronyms. To address this, ISO is used and reflects the Greek word 'isos' which means 'equal.'*

## Explain Regulations and Standards
Many regulations describe their legal authority and also include details describing compliance requirements without referencing a separately maintained standard. 

Examples include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which are both focused on protecting privacy information.

**General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)**
The General Data Protection Regulation enforces rules for organizations that offer services to entities in the European Union (EU) or that collect and/or analyze data on a subject located there. 

GDPR rules are stringent and apply no matter where the originating organization operates from or where the collected data is stored. Failure to comply with GDPR rules results in extremely costly fines.

There are seven principles of the GDPR:
- Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Accuracy
- Storage limitation
- Integrity and confidentiality (security)
- Accountability

**Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)**
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a US federal law designed to protect the privacy of children (inside and outside of the Unites States) under the age of thirteen. 

It requires operators of websites or online services to provide clear privacy policies, details when consent from a parent or guardian is required, and also describes the operator's responsibilities to protect information from being used for marketing purposes.

**Using Legal Contracts to Require Standards Compliance**
Legal contracts can often be used to enforce compliance with external standards or to identify other similar requirements, such as demonstrating that internal programs closely align to industry best practice frameworks. 

Some examples that fall into this category of agreement include PCI-DSS, CMMI, and CSA STAR

**Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global data protection standard established and maintained by a consortium of payment card companies. 

PCI DSS identifies controls designed to prevent fraud and protect credit and debit card data. 

Organizations that take credit and debit cards are required to follow the standards described within the PCI DSS. 

The standard is available via: [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library)

**Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)**
Capability Maturity Model Integration describes five levels of maturity within the operational or software capabilities of an organization. 

Measuring software capabilities is the most common use and this assessment is frequently required by many federal contracts. 

A CMMI assessment is very focused on identifying that all work is defined via well-established processes. 

The results of the assessment establish the maturity level, or score, of an organization. 

The scores include the following:

- Level 1: Initial—Processes do not exist and work is reactive in nature.
- Level 2: Managed—Many work activities are defined via processes but work is still frequently reactive in nature.
- Level 3: Defined—The majority of work is well-defined via processes and proactive measures are in place.
- Level 4: Quantitatively Managed—All work is well-defined via processes, proactive measures are in place, and the work outputs are tracked and analyzed.
- Level 5: Optimizing—Work is well-defined via processes, work is proactive, measured, analyzed, and continuously improved.

**Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) STAR Certification**
The Security, Trust & Assurance registry is maintained by the Cloud Security Alliance. 

The publicly available registry includes CSA STAR assessment details for many cloud service providers. 

A CSA STAR evaluation measures the security capabilities and privacy controls of a cloud service provider against the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM). 

Additional details regarding CSA STAR assessments, as well as links to the public registry, are available via: [https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star)

The CCM is available via: [https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/cloud-controls-matrix/](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/cloud-controls-matrix/)

## Explain Privacy Data
**Protecting Privacy Data**
Privacy protection is a rapidly evolving topic within the field of cybersecurity. 

In the highly connected information age, the amount of data available and the possibilities that analysis of this data provides are practically immeasurable. 

The possibilities and opportunities realized by the collection and analysis of data frequently conflict with the fundamental concepts underpinning ethics and privacy. 

In addition, collecting and using privacy data oftentimes causes conflicts between law enforcement and privacy advocates.

Privacy data generally refers to the type of data that can uniquely identify an individual person. 

The range of data that can be described as personally identifiable information (PII) is very broad and therefore includes definitions of sensitive PII, which generally describes financial information and government-issued identifiers. 

Sensitive PII is subject to very specific controls and discussed in a wide-range of regulations and standards.

Different countries have very different approaches to privacy, and the general concept of "privacy rights" is translated in many ways across the globe. 

In general, privacy describes the capabilities of an individual to maintain control of information.

Many existing, new, and emerging laws are designed to define and protect privacy laws. 

In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA), Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) include specific provisions around the collection, use, and dissemination of privacy data. 

Outside of the United States, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), Japan's Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI), and the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) of Singapore are just a few examples.

***NOTE*** *The United States does not have a federal data privacy law but individual states are beginning to establish their own laws, such as the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA).*

## Understand Certification and Accreditation
Understand Certification and Accreditation

When considering assessment and authorization in a general sense, it represents a formal way for a system owner to gain assurance that a complicated technology solution (for which they are accountable) is configured appropriately and includes all of the required security features for it to operate reliably and safely. 

Assessment can be associated with the system builders. 

It documents their claim that a system has been successfully built according to its requirement and that it is ready to be used in a live production setting. 

Authorization describes the system owner's agreement and acceptance of this claim after which the system in question can "go live." 

Assessment and authorization can be used very effectively in any information technology program to formalize a readiness assessment of a mission-critical system, major upgrade, or change to a mission-critical system.
 
Assessment and Authorization (A&A) take on a new meaning within the U.S. federal government. 

The U.S. federal government uses a very stringent process in order to provide assurance that all agency information systems are compliant with federal standards. 

U.S. federal assessment and authorization is a massive undertaking and, as a result, requires extensive skills and experience to successfully complete.
 
The Assessment and Authorization (A&A) process includes six distinct phases:

- Categorization
- Selection
- Implementation
- Assessment
- Authorization
- Continuous Monitoring

**Categorization**
This phase begins when the system owner and the designated Information System Security Officer (ISSO) identify and formally acknowledge that assessment and authorization is needed for a particular system. 

The categorization phase involves defining the system and categorizing the information processed based on impact levels.

**Selection**
To ensure appropriate security measures, security controls are selected based on the categorization. 

This selection adheres to guidelines outlined in NIST special publication (SP) 800-53, ensuring the system is equipped with necessary protections.

**Implementation**
Following selection, the implementation phase involves deploying the selected controls within the system and documenting the deployment details.

**Assessment**
An independent audit reviews the information system and associated documentation to verify if the necessary controls, as outlined in NIST SP 800-53, have been implemented correctly and are effective.

**Authorization**
To obtain authorization, a special entity called the Authorizing Official (AO) will also review the information system and the results of the independent audit. 

After the AO reviews all necessary elements of the system and determines that the system is compliant with all requirements, a formal letter of authorization will be provided to the system owner that grants the Authority to Operate (ATO) the system for a period of three years.

**Continuous Monitoring**
Continuous monitoring describes the actions taken to ensure that a system continues to operate in a compliant manner. 

The Information System Security Officer (ISSO) has primary responsibility for this important phase and utilizes many administrative, technical, and physical controls to maintain assurances.

It is common for the assessment and authorization process to include measurements and metrics detailed in the ISO standard 15408 - Common Criteria (CC) for Information Technology Security Evaluation, which allows the security attributes of a system to be specifically detailed using a common vernacular.

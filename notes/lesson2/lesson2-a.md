# Summarizing Governance & Compliance Strategies

## Lesson Introduction
The development of a cybersecurity program can follow many paths, but ultimately the path to follow is most often determined by agencies external to the organization. 

Determining which external agency dictates the components of the cybersecurity program is critically important. 

Many times there are multiple external agencies with authority to dictate which controls are in place. 

This lesson will describe many of the common elements found in external mandates and also describe some of the distinguishing characteristics of the most common ones.

## Lesson Objectives
In this lesson, you will:
- Learn about the challenges of integration.
- Explain various geographic location concerns.
- Learn about data management.
- Explore several regulations, accreditation, and standards.
- Learn about the role of compliance frameworks.
- Understand important legal considerations in cybersecurity.
- Learn about the use of contracts to protect legal concerns.

# Identifying Critical Data Assets
The legal and regulatory environment play an especially important role in the selection, development, and management of a cybersecurity program. 

By many measures, industry is shaped and directed by the legal environment in which it operates. 

The legal and regulatory environment serve as a means to both protect and prosecute organizations. 

Failure to understand and utilize the legal and regulatory environment can lead to lawsuits, criminal prosecution, jail, crippling fines, and other serious consequences. 

In contrast to this, and when incorporated in a strategic way, the legal and regulatory environment can provide operational advantages and support the ongoing sustainability of the organization.

## Security Concerns of Integration
Modern organizations depend upon an ever-growing network of vendors, suppliers, and contractors. 

Sometimes these relationships are obvious, but many times they are not. 

As industry has shifted and rapidly expanded its digital presence as a result of the Information Age, more and more data is being collected, used, shared, and analyzed in ways never before imagined. 

Information and services are delivered more quickly, reliably, and accurately than ever before. 

These capabilities depend upon technology and software crafted and developed by organizations that have grown in the same way. 

The result is a wide network of highly dependent businesses representing many layers of vendors suppliers and contractors.

The high dependence on information technology and software, coupled with the high interdependence of organizations, means that cyberattacks can produce far-reaching impacts and more devastating results than ever before. 

Cybersecurity must be woven into an organization's day-to day operations and also in the most senior-level strategic business leadership ranks as well.

## Explain Different Data Types
**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
Personally identifiable information describes data that can be used to directly or indirectly identify an individual. 

This covers a very broad range of information and is further subcategorized to include Sensitive PII, which describes US social security numbers, biometrics, financial records, medical records, immigration identifiers, and criminal history. 

Sensitive PII requires stricter handling and protection than other types of PII.

**Health**
Health data covers a wide range of information and includes not only patients but also doctors and health care systems. 

*Protected Health Information (PHI)* describes data that can be used to identify an individual and includes information about past, present, or future health, as well as related payments and data used in the operation of a healthcare business.

**Financial**
In the broadest terms, financial information describes items such as payment history, credit ratings, and financial statements. 

*Personal Identifiable Financial Information (PIFI)* describes information about a consumer provided to a financial institution and includes information such as account number, credit/debit card number, personal information (such as name and contact information), and social security number. 

Generally, PIFI is used to obtain access to a financial product or service.

**Intellectual Property**
Intellectual property (IP) describes intangible products of human thought and ingenuity. 

Intellectual property is protected by various laws such as copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. 

Intellectual property often represents vast sums of investment money and research time and provides significant competitive or military advantage.

## Understand Data Ownership & Classification
**Data Ownership**
The *data owner* is the entity who is held accountable for the protection of the data under their control. 

The data owner is responsible for ensuring data is appropriately protected. 

To accomplish this the data owner must identify an appropriate classification for the data and coordinate with other teams, such as information technology, to ensure the data is protected according to its classification on a day-to-day basis.

**Data Classification**
*Data classification* Data classifications are typically defined by three levels, and the names of the three levels can vary from organization to organization. Classifications levels can be defined for more than three levels, as required, but doing so can add significant complexity to its management.

Some common classification levels for private-sector organizations include:

- **Public** — Disclosure would not cause a negative impact to the organization.

- **Sensitive** — Disclosure would cause harm to the organization. Data in this classification requires special consideration and well-crafted protections to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    
- **Confidential** — Disclosure would cause considerable harm to the organization. Data in this classification requires extensive analysis and stringent protections to provide the highest levels of assurance of the data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Data Retention
*Data retention* defines the timespan for which data must be kept. 

Retention defines not only the minimum amount of time data must be kept but also the maximum (or "no longer than") timespan. 

Data retention requirements are often identified in data classification levels but the specific details should be defined in separate data retention policies and procedures. 

Effective data retention mitigates the potential issues surrounding data loss but also, and more frequently, for ongoing and future litigation.

The impacts of inadequate data retention practices are often devastating. 

In light of this, it is essential to frequently evaluate compliance with data retention policies and perform validation exercises to test their effectiveness and the capabilities of those responsible for maintaining the data.

## Explain Data Destruction Concepts
**Data Destruction**
Data destruction describes the legally compliant means by which data is removed and made inaccessible. 

Adequate levels of destruction vary but are closely linked to the data's classification. 

In addition, the methods used to destroy data require careful consideration as the widespread adoption of solid state disk and cloud storage complicates the task of confidently destroying data.

**Sanitization**
A general term describing the means by which information is removed from media and includes methods such as clear, purge, and damage. 

Additionally, sanitization requires the removal of all labels, markings, and activity logs.

**Crypto Erase**
Refers to the sanitization of the key used to perform decryption of data, making recovery of the data effectively impossible. 

***NOTE*** *Crypto erase is particularly important when considering cloud platforms where the data is stored on a device and in a location inaccessible to the owner.*

**Clear**
A type of sanitization that involves multiple block-level overwrite cycles. 

This approach protects the data from being recovered from all recovery methods except those that include clean-room type procedures performed at the materials level.

**Purge**
A type of sanitization that provides effective protection from all recovery techniques, including clean-room methods.

**Damage**
Physically breaking a storage device to render it useless or inoperable.

## Understand Geographic Considerations
**Data Sovereignty**
*Data sovereignty* identifies that the laws governing the country in which data is stored have control over the data and describes the legal dynamics of data collection and use in a global economy. 

Laws vary widely from country to country and can impose restrictions on how data is used, how it can be moved from one country to another, as well as limitations on the type of encryption used to protect it.

Cloud computing highlights the complexities of data sovereignty. 

A key attribute of cloud computing is the ease at which services can be established around the globe to fortify performance and availability. 

These capabilities conflict with the legal risks of performing these same tasks.

***NOTE*** *Some organizations establish operations in countries that have a supporting legal framework. For example, organizations focused on privacy and anonymity operate out of Switzerland because of the country's uniquely protective privacy laws.*

When constructing technology solutions to support the organization, it is important to consider the location of the data, the location of the data subject, and the location of the cloud provider. 

With the widespread adoption of public cloud infrastructures, it becomes likely that an organization incorporated in the United States can collect data on an individual living in India and store the data at a cloud provider located within the EU. 

The legal ramifications of this arrangement are complicated by the diverse separation of these important elements and the multitude of laws in place within each country designed to protect security, privacy, and national interests.

## Explain Third-Party Compliance
**Contrasting Risk Perspectives**
In light of the fact that few, if any, organizations run without considerable dependence on third parties, it becomes apparent that considerable risk to operations and data protection requirements exists within these third-party arrangements. 

By leveraging the workforce and expertise of an external enterprise, most third-party arrangements are viewed as a mechanism by which costs and risks can be reduced. 

The facts are oftentimes quite the opposite. 

When selecting a third party it is essential to carefully analyze their information technology, systems, policies, procedures, and cybersecurity program to ensure it meets the requirements of the hiring organization. 

Neglecting to do so can have severe financial, regulatory, and reputational impacts.

**Attestation of Compliance**
An *attestation of compliance (AOC)* describes the set of policies, contracts, and standards identified as essential in the agreement between two parties. 

The attestation of compliance essentially defines how the relationship will be governed. 

For example, the procurement of services, data protection requirements, privacy protection requirements, use of independent auditors and assessors, incident reporting, and definitions of what constitutes a violation must all be documented and agreed upon.
